# Inclusive Job Matcher

An AI-powered, accessibility-first job recommendation platform that helps people with disabilities find inclusive jobs and auto-generate tailored resumes.

---

## Project Overview

Finding jobs that truly consider accessibility needs is a challenge for many people with disabilities.  
This project bridges that gap by combining Large Language Models (Gemini), data engineering pipelines, and Streamlit to:

- Recommend jobs that align with a candidate’s skills, education, and accessibility requirements  
- Generate ATS-friendly resumes tailored to the top job postings  
- Provide an accessible and user-friendly interface  

---

## Problem Statement

- Traditional job boards do not highlight accessibility features in job postings  
- Applicants often spend hours tailoring resumes manually  
- Lack of centralized, DEI-focused platforms makes the job search harder for underrepresented communities  

---

## Solution

Our platform addresses these challenges by:

- Using **Gemini LLM** to filter and summarize job descriptions  
- Providing a **multi-page Streamlit application** for profile entry, job recommendations, and resume generation  
- Ensuring **built-in accessibility features** such as font size toggle, high contrast mode, and text-to-speech  
- Offering a **lightweight Application Tracker** for manual job application status logging
